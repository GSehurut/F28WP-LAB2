# F28WP-LAB2


The focus of this lab was client side programming using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Objects, Arrays and DOM API. The aim was to develop a simple(single user) game without any server interactions. 

We had two characters on a game board:
- Bear; controlled by the user through the keyboard key (up, down, left and right)
- Bees; moves randomly to attack the bear

The objective of the player is to minimise the number of stings. The are functions to adjust, the speed of the bees.
